# Object-Oriented-Programming

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm which focuses its attention on how to best describe concepts which exist in the real world programmatically.   Objects are the constructs which we use as software engineers to describe the aforementioned real-world concepts.   We use variables as our means to describe the intrinsic characteristics of real-world concepts.  While methods are used to describe the behavior of these concepts.
